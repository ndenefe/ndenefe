      <h1>Welcome to Ndenefe.com!</h1>
      <p>This is the homepage of Noah Denefe. It is written using the Angular framework, and is currently running off a mock-api. At the moment, this site is very much reliant on bootstrap 4, but eventually I plan to overwrite some of the bootstrap with my own css to truly make this site unique. Right now you can see which courses I have enrolled in this as well as previous semesters, and also take a look at the beginnings of a Japanese study page I am working on. Hopefully you enjoy this site in its current state. Thanks for the read.</p>
